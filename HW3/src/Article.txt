A studdy revealed more than four-in-10 teachers failed to understand some
pupils' writing because it was so litttered with obscure language.

Phrases such as "innit" and Gr8 are now regularly found in school work, it was
claimed.

One teacher told how an essay contained the sentence "i noe u dnt noee mii, i
donno huu u r" - I know you do not know me, I do not know who you are. Another
student wrote "ma m8s wnt ova" - my mates went over.

It was revealed that, in one case, four teachers had to mark a pupil's essay
together because it was so confusing.

According to the survey of 500 teachers, almost 55 per cent believed children's
gramar was now worse than it used to be. Many said children now failed to tell
the difference between standard English and colloqualisms.

The report - comissioned by the satellite channel, Teachers TV - listed examples
of street language found in an essay on Shakespeare.

It included "Macbeth couldn't be arsed...", "Macbeth he is well wicked",
"Macbeth was pure mental" and "Romeo was a numpty, wasn't he?"

In an esay on the Second World War, a pupil wrote: "Hitler was majorly bad."

Andrew Bethell, Teachers TV chief executive, said: "Pupils are increasingly
communicating through colloquial language in the classroom, with some teachers
accepting this as the norm. However, the correct use of grammar is vital if
education standards are to be maintained and improved." The study said many
teachers were now picking up on pupils' phrases, but some were left confused.

More than half of staff failed to recognise that "phat" meant "great", almost 50
per cent did not understand that "klingon" was used for a younger brother or
sistar and a quarter did not know "vanilla checks" was slang for "boring
clothes".
