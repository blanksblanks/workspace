/* Instructions 
 * In this assignment you'll be making a simple counter using 
 * static variables. The counter should initially be 0 and, 
 * there should be the following functionality: 
 *   1) function: increment 
 *      increase the value of the counter by exactly one. 
 *      it should not return any value 
 *   2) function: getCount 
 *      returns the value of the counter 
 *   3) function: lastCount 
 *      returns the value of the counter the last time that 
 *      getCount was called or 0 if it has yet to be called 
 *   4) function: sinceLastCount 
 *      returns the number of times the counter has been 
 *      incremented since getCount was last called or since 
 *      the program was started, whichever is smaller
