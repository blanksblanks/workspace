/**
 * 
 * Expression Tree
 * 
 * @author nb2406
 * 
 *         Implementing and displaying expression trees: Your program will be a
 *         text-based Java application. Prompt the user to enter a postfix
 *         expression (made up of single digit numbers and the +, -, *, and /
 *         operators). When the user presses enter, the stack based method for
 *         constructing expression trees will be executed. Use your stack from
 *         the previous question. You should implement your own ExpressionTree
 *         class to store the expression. Once the tree has been built, have
 *         your program use the tree to output the equivalent prefix expression
 *         and infix expression (don't forget parenthesis for this one). Finally
 *         the program should evaluate the expression tree and print the result.
 * 
 *         Clarifications: There are two kinds of bad situations you need to
 *         account for. The first is if you pop from the stack and the stack
 *         happens to be empty. When this happens, your program should die
 *         gracefully and tell the user what went wrong. The second case is at
 *         the end of the algorithm when you pop from the stack one last time.
 *         If the stack still has elements on it, then you will also need to die
 *         gracefully and tell the user what went wrong.
