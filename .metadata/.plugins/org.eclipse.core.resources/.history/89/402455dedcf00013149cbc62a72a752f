/* Instructions 
 * Write functions that, given an array of ints: 
 *   1) function: odds 
 *      add up every other item in the array, starting with the first 
 *      note that if there are no such items, the sum is 0 
 *      return the sum 
 *   2) function: evens 
 *      add up every other item in the array, starting with the second 
 *      anote that if there are no such items, the sum is 0 
 *      return the sum 
 *   3) function: product 
 *      multiply all the numbers together -- if the array is empty, 
 *      you should return 1 
 *      return the result 
 *   4) function: parity 
 *      calculate whether the sum of the numbers is even or odd 
 *      you ARE NOT ALLOWED to add the numbers together first, either 
 *      you CANNOT use any of the other functions you've written for 
 *      this or the other three problems in this assignment. 
 *      note that if the array is of length 0, i.e. there are no numbers 
 *      to add, then the sum is 0 which is even 
 *      return the true if the sum is odd, false if it is even
