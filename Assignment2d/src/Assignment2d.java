/* Instructions 
 * Design a choose your own adventure 
 * You should print some bit of story, then ask the user 
 * what they want to do. 
 * When you make your project in Eclipse, you should do the following: 
 *   1) copy this file into the src directory 
 *   2) copy the Choice.java file into the src directory 
 * When you want to ask the user to choose between different adventure 
 * options, you can use 
 *   int userChoice = Choice.choose( 
 *       "Choice1", 
 *       "Choice2", 
 *       "SomeOtherChoice" 
 *   ); 
 * and userChoice will be 0 if the user chose Choice1, 1 if they chose 
 * Choice2, and 2 if they chose SomeOtherChoice. Note that you can have 
 * 1 option (just Choice1), two options, 20 options, etc. It works with 
 * a variable number of values. 
 * 
 * There should be at least 12 different `pages' you can be 
 * on and several different paths towards (possibly more than 
 * one) ending. Note that you will receive bonus points based 
 * on how fun / entertaining it is. 
 * Each `page' should be its own action, by the way.
